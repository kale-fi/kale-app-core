Next Steps
Fix Remaining Test Issues:
The tests for the kale-bank module need to be updated to match the SDK v0.50.x interfaces and initialization patterns
The import cycle in the kalefi module needs to be resolved
Complete Module Updates:
Ensure all modules are fully compatible with SDK v0.50.x
Update any remaining code that might be using deprecated patterns
Verify Full Functionality:
Test all application features to ensure they work correctly with SDK v0.50.x
Run integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality
